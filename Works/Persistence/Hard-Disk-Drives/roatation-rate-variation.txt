Q3. Do the same requests above, but change the rotation rate
: -R 0.1, -R 0.5,-R 0.01. How do the times change?

Assumption : 
With workloads which needs rotation (but most of them needs a rotation),
the higher the rotation rates, the faster the time taken for rotation.
!! Wait, maybe NOT. 
	if a workloads need seek operations, it can depends on the distance at that time when finish the seek operation.
	However, overall, I guess rotation time would be shorten because, if there is a distance variation, fast rotation rates will assure faster arrival at the wanted location.

-> the higher the rotation rate -> the less rotation time

Results: Assumption seems correct
