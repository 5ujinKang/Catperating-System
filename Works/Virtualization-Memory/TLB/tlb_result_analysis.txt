Overall, it looks normal for a system with:
- A small first-level TLB (~16-32 entries/pages),
- A larger but slower second-level TLB (~512 to 1024 entries),
- Then costly misses beyond that.

estimate TLB sizes:
- L1 TLB size somewhere around 16-32 pages,
- L2 TLB or unified TLB somewhere around 512-1024 pages,
- Miss penalty starting above that.

One thing to watch:
The slight dip from 1 to 4 pages (3.35 to 1.45 ns) is unusual 
â€” usually time shouldn't drop below for larger working sets. 

Might be measurement noise or caching effects.
